Welcome!
This is a simple presentation of all the employees at tretton37. I've tried 
to make it as simple as possible with no extra clutter. 
No installation, just run index.html.

DESIGN/ACCESSIBILITY

+ Fancy animations (1 point) +
You're welcomed with a typewriter animation/effect on the hero-text. Also a 
blinking caret. 
Hover the card or the list and there is a slight transformation.

Some divs have a role="button" to make it easier to tab through.

+ A modern design (1 point) +
Well this one is highly subjective. I went with a design that is made to 
look like 3D-buttons and cards. Clean and easy on the eyes.

+ No UI framework used (1 point) +
Not much to say about this? Bootstrap is nice and all but not this time.

+ Responsive desgin, works on mobile and tablets (2 points) +
The media queries at the buttom of styles.css makes for a better reading 
experiance on smaller devices. Less padding here and there.

FUNCTIONALITY

+ Filter by office (1 point) +
Filter out employees and only show employees of a certain office.

A button to be able to switch between a grid layout and a list layout. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TESTING/QA

+ Works in Chrome, Firefox and Edge (1 point) +
I went with a fetch function that according to www.caniuse.com works on all
the latest releases of Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
